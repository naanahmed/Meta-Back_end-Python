Python does not really have a method of declaring multiline comments so a # symbol can be used at the beginning of every line of the comment
Data Types :
    Numeric : integer, float, complex number
    Sequence : string, list, tuples(its values cant be changed)
    Dictionary 
    Boolean
    Set : unordered, unindexed, non-repeated set of values
Type Casting :
    implicit : automatic, to prevent data loss, only if compatible otherwise Type error
    explicit : str(), int(), float(), ord(), hex(), oct()

Everything that a user types in, is converted, by Python, to the string data type.
Python's implicit type conversion works when I use the + operator on strings and integers, it does not work on strings and floats.   
Three types of Operations : Mathematical, Logical,Comparison
The If, else and elif (else if) statements are conditional flow controls.
The while and for loop are also flow controls but they are not conditional.
